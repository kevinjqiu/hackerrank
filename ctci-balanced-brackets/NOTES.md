Use stack
=========

For each character, if it's the matching parens for the top of the stack, pop the stack. Otherwise add it to the stack.
When we reach to the end of the string, return True if the stack is empty, and False otherwise.

I remember from a couple years back that there's a way to not using a stack... forgot how...
